## 1. Introduction:

The development of AI-powered customer support chatbots represents a significant area of investment for organizations seeking to enhance customer experience while optimizing operational efficiency. The effectiveness of these systems hinges not only on the underlying AI technologies but also on how effectively humans can communicate requirements, scenarios, and expectations to these systems during the development process.
This report investigates how different prompting techniques influence the quality, comprehensiveness, and actionability of AI-generated outputs specifically within the context of customer support chatbot development. The three prompting techniques examined—straightforward prompts, tabular format prompting, and preceding question prompting—represent distinct approaches to AI interaction that may offer varying advantages depending on the specific development task at hand.
Straightforward prompts represent the most direct approach, with concise, unstructured queries. Tabular format prompting utilizes structured, table-based instructions that organize information systematically.
